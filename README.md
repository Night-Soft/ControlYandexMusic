## Features

- Create a window containing the current playlist and player control buttons.
- Switch track to the selected one from the track list.

- View and open a cover of any track.
- Use keyboard keys.


## Important
A [non-standard API](https://github.com/Night-Soft/YmExternalAPI)
is used to work with the new design, since Yandex has not yet provided official support, as it did in the previous version of the interface. Unfortunately, this means that the application may stop working in the new design at any time.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/Night-Soft/ControlYandexMusic.git
  cd ControlYandexMusic
  git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Next, go to chrome://extensions/. Enable developer mode. Then click "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the extension files. `ControlYandexMusic/extension/`
